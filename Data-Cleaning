Load libraries and data
```{r}
library(RSQLite)
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)

df = read.csv("C:/Users/Genzel/Desktop/Data Science/Final Projects/wls2011health.csv")
view = View # short cut for View() function
```

Load codebook for reference
```{r}
sqlite <- dbDriver("SQLite")
wlsdb <- dbConnect(sqlite, "C:/Users/Genzel/Desktop/Data Science/Final Projects/wisc-codebook.sqlite")

questions = dbGetQuery(wlsdb, "select * from questions")
answers = dbGetQuery(wlsdb, "select * from answers")

# questions and answer data frames
dfq = questions[questions$id %in% names(df),]
dfa = answers[answers$qid %in% names(df),]
```

Data cleaning 
```{r}
facts = df[sapply(df, is.factor)]
levs = sapply(facts, function(x){
  levs1 = levels(x)
  levs1 = levs1[-grep("proxy|refused|left|ascertained|inappropriate|don't know",levs1)]
  paste(levs1, collapse = ",")
})

noYeses   = facts[levs == "no,yes"]                                                 # Select yes/no answer columns
noYeses[] = lapply(noYeses, function(x){as.numeric(factor(x, c("no", "yes"))) - 1}) # converts yes to 1 and no to 0
noYeses[] = lapply(noYeses, function(x){ifelse(is.na(x), median(x, na.rm = T), x)}) # sets NAs to column medians 
```

Search for irrelevant columns
```{r}
get_codes = function(dframe){
  dfq[dfq$id %in% colnames(dframe),]
}

cdfq = get_codes(noYeses) # used to search for remaining columns to clear out
```

Removing irrelevant columns by code
```{r}
# health insurance codes: jxhi
# doctor trust code: jxha88re
# alcohol memory code: jxab05re
cdf = noYeses[, -grep("jxhi|jxha88re|jxab05re", colnames(noYeses))]
```

Removing irrelevant columns by text 
```{r}
# Remove treatments, weight loss actions, meds, drinking, ER use,
# internet use, smoking, family other than siblings, doctor
# coordination, and willingness to donate organs
rdfq = cdfq[grep("treatment|lose|medications|drink|emergency|Internet|smoke|father|mother|son|daughters|one doctor|don", cdfq$text),]
cdf = cdf[,!(colnames(cdf) %in% rdfq$id)]
cdfq = get_codes(cdf)
```

Shortening question text for quick readability and understanding
```{r}
text_dfq = cdfq

# Fixed = True, removal
text_dfq$text = gsub("?", "", text_dfq$text, fixed = T)
text_dfq$text = gsub("(such as on TV or the radio, in the newspapers or by someone you know), do you ", "", text_dfq$text, fixed = T)

# Replacement
# It was most efficient to not use lapply or MAP and lists 
# in order to be able to quickly check each replacement

text_dfq$text = gsub("have you accomplished less than you would like with your", "less", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub(" or other daily activities as a result of your physical health", "/activities due to poor health", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub(" or other regular activities as a result of any emotional problems, such as feeling depressed or anxious", "/activities due to anxiety or depression", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub(" or other activities you could do as a result of your physical health", "/activities due to poor health", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("than usual as a result of any emotional problems, such as feeling depressed or anxious", " due to anxiety or depression", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("conversations in person ", "people ", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("conversations on the phone ", "on phone ", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("with understanding spoken instructions from your doctor, employer or other person", "understanding people", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("with understanding written instructions", "understanding text", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("often worry about the possibility that you have a serious illness", "often worry that you may have a serious illness", text_dfq$text)
text_dfq$text = gsub("a disease is brought to your attention", "made aware of disease", text_dfq$text)

# Removal
text_dfq$text = gsub("Do you have any |During the past 4 weeks, |Has a medical professional ever said that you have |Have you experienced increased |Have any of your biological |Do you |Are you |did you do |find that you are |Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you have |Have you had |yourself|and carrying something as heavy as |, such as a bag of groceries|, such as a bag of pet food|, such as a living room chair|or being on your feet |were you | or other activities|in the daytime when you have to struggle against falling asleep |on medicine bottles or other places|there is ", "", text_dfq$text)
```

Remove unnecessary columns from questions data
```{r}
text_dfq = text_dfq[,1:2]
```
